# Axmol source basis

Use these sources to audit or update this package. The official wiki was checked at commit
`06dc32806027c679e6f2a94103dd9bb2e07aad8f`; v2 implementation claims were checked against tag
`v2.11.4` (`b14941e6f50a0ce12489bd8f57041e093fb58819`) on 7 August 2026.

## Version and scope

- [GitHub releases API](https://api.github.com/repos/axmolengine/axmol/releases) and the
  [v2.11.4 release](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/releases/tag/v2.11.4) establish that
  v2.11.4 was the latest published v2 release on the verification date and labels it LTS. They do
  not establish that no later v2 minor can ship, so this package no longer makes that claim.
- [About the upcoming Axmol v3](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/wiki/About-RHI-in-Axmol-v3)
  states that v3 remains in active development and recommends v2 when a stable release is required.
- [Axmol v2.11.4 README](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/v2.11.4/README.md) and
  [Axmol versus Cocos2d-x](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/wiki/Axmol-vs-Cocos2d%E2%80%90x)
  establish the fork, C++20 line, platforms, and backends. The skill does not repeat that feature
  inventory because it does not change execution.

## Memory

- [Memory Management](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/wiki/Memory-Management) establishes the
  initial reference count, balanced `retain()`/`release()`, autorelease timing, `create()` convention,
  parent ownership, `RefPtr`, and engine containers. Its `AX_REF_LEAK_DETECTION` name is stale for
  the pinned release; v2.11.4 source uses `AX_OBJECT_LEAK_DETECTION`, so the skill follows the tagged
  implementation. The worked leak and dangling examples are the basis for [memory.md](memory.md).
- Tagged source confirms the contract in
  [`Object.cpp`](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/v2.11.4/core/base/Object.cpp),
  [`RefPtr.h`](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/v2.11.4/core/base/RefPtr.h), and
  [`Vector.h`](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/v2.11.4/core/base/Vector.h).

## Graphics

- [Shaders in Axmol 2.x](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/wiki/Shaders-in-Axmol-2.x)
  establishes accepted shader languages, generated variants, the one non-sampler uniform block per
  stage rule, `#include`, custom-shader batching behavior, and `updateBatchId()` conditions.
  [Shaders in Axmol 3](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/wiki/Shaders-in-Axmol3) establishes that
  v3 uses a different authoring and binding model.
- [The GLSL 4.50 specification](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/specs/gl/GLSLangSpec.4.50.pdf),
  section 3.3, requires `#version` before anything except whitespace or comments. The package keeps
  the conservative line-one form but removed the unsupported assertion that any leading comment
  universally breaks Axmol.
- [Sprite Sheets: Tools and Formats](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/wiki/Sprite-Sheets-Tools-and-Formats)
  establishes the global frame-name collision and prefix/subdirectory replacements.
- Tagged [`Texture2D.cpp`](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/v2.11.4/core/renderer/Texture2D.cpp#L610-L640)
  establishes that `setAliasTexParameters()` selects nearest sampling and
  `setAntiAliasTexParameters()` selects linear sampling. NASA Earth Observatory's practitioner note
  [Design basics: anti-aliasing](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/elegantfigures/2010/09/24/163/)
  explains why blended resampling, unlike nearest-neighbor, preserves antialiased detail when an
  image is reduced. An anonymized first-hand Axmol v2.11.3 record reproduced the scaled-UI symptom;
  the tagged source and practitioner guidance establish the scoped replacement.
- [SDF text rendering](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/wiki/SDF-text-rendering) establishes the
  outline ranges and the coupled spread/shader scale.

## Scene, input, and physics

- Tagged [`RenderView.cpp`](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/v2.11.4/core/platform/RenderView.cpp)
  establishes the exact v2.11.4 resolution-policy behavior of frame, design, visible size, and
  visible origin. It contradicts the previous universal negative-origin description, which was
  removed.
- Tagged [`StencilStateManager.cpp`](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/v2.11.4/core/base/StencilStateManager.cpp)
  implements nested stencil layers, and the engine ships a
  [`NestedTest`](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/v2.11.4/tests/cpp-tests/Source/ClippingNodeTest/ClippingNodeTest.cpp).
  Together they contradict the previous ban on nested `ClippingNode`; the revised guidance asks for
  a reduced backend-specific reproduction instead. Tagged
  [`ClippingRectangleNode.cpp`](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/v2.11.4/core/2d/ClippingRectangleNode.cpp)
  establishes the scissor-based rectangular replacement.
- Tagged [`EventListenerMouse.h`](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/v2.11.4/core/base/EventListenerMouse.h)
  establishes the `bool` callbacks for v2.11.4. The
  [PR 3173 migration guide](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/wiki/Migration-Guide-for-PR-3173)
  establishes the v3 pointer/input replacements.
- Tagged [`EventListener.h`](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/v2.11.4/core/base/EventListener.h)
  establishes that node-associated listeners follow node enter/exit state while fixed-priority
  listeners do not; this is the basis for preferring node-bound listeners or explicit teardown.
- Tagged [`RenderViewImpl.cpp` dispatch](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/v2.11.4/core/platform/RenderViewImpl.cpp#L1246-L1268)
  establishes the v2 desktop keyboard-before-IME order and unconsumed control-key fallback; its
  [`key map`](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/v2.11.4/core/platform/RenderViewImpl.cpp#L338-L342)
  maps GLFW Super to `KEY_HYPER`. Tagged
  [`TextFieldTTF.cpp`](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/v2.11.4/core/2d/TextFieldTTF.cpp#L254-L312) and
  [`TextFieldTTF.h`](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/v2.11.4/core/2d/TextFieldTTF.h#L225-L258)
  establish newline detachment and the absence of a cursor-position getter. Tagged
  [`Label.cpp` TTF configuration](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/v2.11.4/core/2d/Label.cpp#L827-L830)
  and [`system-font sizing`](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/v2.11.4/core/2d/Label.cpp#L2326-L2334)
  establish that `setSystemFontSize()` selects `STRING_TEXTURE` while `setTTFConfig()` preserves the
  TTF path. An
  anonymized first-hand Axmol v2.11.3 desktop record supplies the four symptoms and adopted
  replacements; v2.11.4 tagged source supplies their exact causes and confirms the paths remain.
- [FAQ](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/wiki/FAQ) documents Android interception of three-or-more
  point gestures and the resulting missing terminal touch event.
- [2D Physics Engines](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/wiki/2D-Physics-Engines-Information)
  establishes that content size cannot change after a body is attached and that animation frames
  must therefore share a size.

## Setup, build, and extensions

- Tagged [DevSetup](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/v2.11.4/docs/DevSetup.md) and the
  [FAQ](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/wiki/FAQ) establish `setup.ps1`, platform setup options,
  PowerShell policy handling, source-glob regeneration, and the branch/axslcc mismatch diagnosis.
- [Introduction to Game Development using Axmol](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/wiki/Introduction-to-Game-Dev-using-Axmol)
  tells users to modify their generated project rather than the engine or template tree; this is the
  source for keeping project changes outside the pinned submodule.
- [Extensions](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/wiki/Extensions) and the tagged
  [`AXGameEngineOptions.cmake`](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/v2.11.4/templates/common/cmake/modules/AXGameEngineOptions.cmake)
  establish extension flags and defaults. The guidance avoids copying their feature table and tells
  agents to inspect the pinned file when an extension task actually needs it.
- Community discussion
  [Axmol build time improvement #1814](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/discussions/1814)
  records a 7–15 minute Xcode rebuild, an optional ccache mitigation, a maintainer's failure to
  reproduce it, and advice to keep project inputs out of generated build directories. It does not
  support calling ccache the fix or prescribing another generator universally; those claims were
  removed.

## Migration

- [Cocos2d-x migration guide](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/wiki/Cocos2d%E2%80%90x-migration-guide)
  establishes the compatibility header, modernized names/types, and `axmol-migrate`'s v4.0 scope and
  warning for older projects.
- In community discussion
  [Using Axmol as a replacement engine #1129](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/discussions/1129),
  maintainer rh101 recommends generating a new Axmol project and moving code/resources because the
  CMake and Android files differ materially. This is the preferred port replacement in
  [migration.md](migration.md).
- [PR 3173 migration guide](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/wiki/Migration-Guide-for-PR-3173)
  establishes the v3 input, text, keyboard, and label replacements. Later
  [PR 3228 guidance](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/wiki/Migration-Guide-for-PR-3228) shows that
  pointer APIs continued changing, which is why the skill requires the pinned headers.
- [Axmol v3 roadmap #2650](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/discussions/2650) records planned and
  in-progress removals, C++23, RHIs, physics, and platform work. It is a roadmap discussion, not a
  release contract.

## Architecture and practitioner evidence

- [Game Programming Patterns: Decoupling Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/decoupling-patterns.html)
  explains why reducing coupling makes a codebase easier to change and understand. Combined with
  Axmol's documented ownership/runtime model, it supports keeping engine types at the presentation
  seam.
- `using-cpp`, where it is installed, owns the general C++ layering, deterministic-core, RAII,
  and CMake build-loop rules.
  This package retains only the Axmol-specific boundary: do not let `ax::Object` ownership or a
  graphics runtime become a dependency of the domain test target.

Other records from two anonymous Axmol v2.11.x projects drove claims about negative origins, nested
clipping, early layout timing, DrawNode anti-aliasing, premultiplied-alpha transforms, and four
macOS/Ninja build fixes. They were contradicted by tagged source or lacked independent evidence, so
this package does not teach them as Axmol rules.
